Kolin wallet is a free mobile app that can be used to access all features that your Kolin can grant. The wallet is connected directly to the Waves main nodes in order to retrieve your transactions and send payments.

Send and store your Kolin tokens, trade them on the DEX or even use this wallet as a mobile multicurrency wallet.

The Kolin wallet allows you to:
- Check your transactions (both pending and confirmed).
- Send KOLIN to anyone via direct address, QR code or from the Address Book.
- Request funds via QR code or by sharing an app link.
- Support multiple wallets in one device.
- Manage your Kolin and other cryptocurrencies.
- Pair your mobile Kolin wallet with the Chrome Lite wallet.
- Wallet seed protected by Touch ID.
- Backup seed functionality.
- DEX (Charts, OrderBook, Manage your orders, and WatchList).

Security:

During registration, the most important information is your wallet seed.
Save your seed somewhere safe, offline. You can also write it down on a piece of paper or print it as a QR code.

You can always import your account again using your seed.
The seed is stored on your Phone Keychain and securely protected by Touch ID or password. 

The seed is decrypted when you want to sign and send a transaction.
Every transaction is signed locally and transmitted to the node without revealing your wallet seed or private keys.
